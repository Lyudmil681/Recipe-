<h2><strong> Ganache Ingredients</strong></h2>
<p>Make the best chocolate ganache of your life with just two (or three) ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><h3><strong>Bittersweet Chocolate</strong></h3></li>
<p>Instead of milk chocolate, use bittersweet or semisweet chocolate for ganache. This yields a richer, more complex flavor.</p>
<p></p>
<li><h3><strong>Heavy Cream</strong></h3></li>
<p>Heavy cream thins the melted chocolate and creates a smooth, velvety texture.</p>
<p></p>
<li><h3><strong>Rum (Optional)</strong></h3></li>
<p>You don't have to add dark rum if you don't have it on hand. However, it does add a subtle boozy flavor that takes this chocolate ganache over the top.</p></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
